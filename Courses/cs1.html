        <p>
          The aim of “Reinforced Informatics 1 (Introduction to Algorithms)” is to study the
          mathematical, logical and algorithmic foundations of computer science, as well as the basic
          ideas of algorithms and data structures. The course introduces fundamental concepts and
          principles that provide a strong theoretical and practical basis for subsequent informatics
          subjects, including number systems, propositional logic, basic algorithmic structures, arrays,
          graphs, trees and classical sorting methods.

      <!-- Assessment & Grading -->
      <section class="card">
        <h2>Assessment &amp; Grading</h2>
        <p>
          Assessment is based on two written examinations: one intermediate test and one final exam.
          All evaluations are individual. Each assessment consists of
          <strong>4 problems worth 5 points each</strong> for a total of 20 points.
        </p>
        <p>
          The final grade is composed as follows:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>First written test</strong> – duration: <strong>0.5–1.5 hours</strong>,
            weight: <strong>50%</strong> of the overall 20-point grade.
            Problems cover the mathematical and logical foundations of computer science and the basics
            of algorithmisation (branching and loop algorithms, one-dimensional arrays).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Second written exam</strong> – duration: <strong>2 hours</strong>,
            weight: <strong>50%</strong> of the overall 20-point grade.
            Problems require applying algorithmic knowledge to two-dimensional arrays and recursion,
            as well as tasks on data structures and sorting algorithms.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Full credit for a problem (5 points) is awarded when the student presents a completely correct
          and well-explained solution. Partial credit (2–4 points) is given when the main concepts are
          understood but minor mistakes occur (e.g. slight inaccuracies in a truth table or a flowchart).
          Minimal credit (1–1.5 points) is awarded when the student attempts the solution but shows
          significant conceptual misunderstandings or largely incorrect results.
        </p>
      </section>

      <!-- Teaching Methods & Prerequisites -->
      <section class="card">
        <h2>Teaching Methods &amp; Prerequisites</h2>
        <p>
          Teaching is practice-oriented and based on real or realistic examples and systematic solution
          of diverse types of problems. Students are guided through interactive activities to develop
          problem-solving skills, discover effective learning strategies and strengthen critical thinking,
          helping them retain and apply knowledge in later courses.
        </p>
        <p>
          To enrol in this course, students should have school-level knowledge of mathematics and
          informatics. These prerequisites ensure familiarity with basic numerical operations,
          elementary logic and introductory programming concepts.
