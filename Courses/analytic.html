        <p>
          The course carries <strong>4 ECTS credits</strong> and includes a total of
          <strong>42 contact hours</strong>, divided equally into
          <strong>21 hours of lectures</strong> and <strong>21 hours of tutorials /
          practical sessions</strong>. There is no separate laboratory or project component

        <h2>Aim of the Course</h2>
        <p>
          The aim of “Analytic Geometry &amp; Algebra” is to provide students with the basic
          tools of algebra and analytic geometry needed for subsequent study of mathematical
          analysis and applied disciplines. The course develops skills in working with vectors,
          coordinates, matrices and systems of linear equations, and introduces polynomial
          techniques. It strengthens logical and algorithmic thinking and the ability to model
          and solve quantitative problems that appear in computer science and related fields.

      <!-- Assessment & grading -->
      <section class="card">
        <h2>Assessment &amp; Grading</h2>
        <p>
          Assessment is based on written examinations, including an intermediate test and a
          final exam. All evaluations are individual. The intermediate exam typically combines
          short questions or multiple-choice tasks with commentary and several standard
          problems with sub-questions. The final exam consists of a set of typical problems
          with multiple sub-questions.
        </p>
        <p>
          The final grade is composed of two written assessments:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Short written test – weight: <strong>40%</strong>.</li>
          <li>Final written exam – weight: <strong>60%</strong>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Each correct intermediate step is graded, even if the final numerical answer is not
          correct; such steps receive partial credit depending on their importance.
          Copying only the problem statement or solving a different problem than the assigned
          one results in <strong>0 points</strong> for that task.
        </p>
        <p>
          Numerical errors typically result in a small deduction from the points allocated to
          the problem; if a numerical mistake does not affect the logic of the solution, only
          a limited penalty is applied. Logical errors lead to a larger deduction, depending
          on the severity of the mistake and its impact on the solution.

      <!-- Teaching methods & prerequisites -->
      <section class="card">
        <h2>Teaching Methods &amp; Prerequisites</h2>
        <p>
          Teaching combines theoretical explanations with many worked examples and practical
          exercises. Students regularly solve diverse types of problems in tutorials, applying
          algebraic and geometric methods to concrete situations and developing confidence in
          symbolic computations.
        </p>
        <p>
          To enrol in “Analytic Geometry &amp; Algebra”, students should have school-level
          knowledge of algebra and geometry. These prerequisites ensure familiarity with
          basic equations, inequalities and geometric constructions on which the course
          builds.
