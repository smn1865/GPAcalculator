        <h2>Credits &amp; Workload</h2>
        <p>
          The course carries <strong>6 ECTS credits</strong> and includes a total of
          <strong>42 contact hours</strong>, all in the form of lectures with practical elements.
          There is no separate laboratory or project component specified. In addition, students are

        <h2>Aim of the Course</h2>
        <p>
          The aim of “Mathematics 1” is to provide students with the fundamental tools of mathematical
          analysis — limits, continuity, derivatives and integrals. These concepts are essential for
          advanced study in mathematics and for solving problems in applied sciences, economics, engineering
          and computer science. The course builds the analytical foundation required to model real-world
          phenomena, reason rigorously about quantitative relationships and tackle a wide range of
          scientific and technical tasks.

        <h2>Assessment &amp; Grading</h2>
        <p>
          Assessment is based on written examinations, including an intermediate test and a final exam.
          All evaluations are individual. The intermediate exam usually combines a multiple-choice test
          with commentary and 3-4 typical problems with sub-questions. The final exam consists of 4-5
          typical problems with several sub-questions each.
        </p>
        <p>
          The final grade is composed of two written assessments:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Short written test - <strong>1 h 10 min</strong>, weight: <strong>40%</strong>.</li>
          <li>Final written exam - <strong>2 h</strong>, weight: <strong>60%</strong>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Each correct intermediate step is graded, even if the final numerical answer is not correct;
          such steps receive from <strong>0.25</strong> points upwards depending on importance.
          Copying only the problem statement or solving a different problem than the assigned one
          results in <strong>0 points</strong> for that task.
        </p>
        <p>
          Numerical errors typically result in a deduction of <strong>0.25-0.5 points</strong> from
          the points allocated to the problem; if a numerical mistake does not affect the logic
          of the solution, no more than <strong>0.5 points</strong> are subtracted. Logical errors
          lead to at least <strong>0.5 points</strong> being deducted, depending on severity.
        </p>

        <h2>Teaching Methods &amp; Prerequisites</h2>
        <p>
          Teaching combines theoretical explanations with a large number of worked examples and
          real-life-inspired problems. Students regularly solve diverse types of exercises in class,
          connecting abstract concepts with concrete applications.
        </p>
        <p>
          To enrol in “Mathematics 1”, students should already have school-level knowledge of algebra
          and basic elements of mathematical analysis. These prerequisites ensure familiarity with the
          fundamental concepts and techniques that the course develops further.
