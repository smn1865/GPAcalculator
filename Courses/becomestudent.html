      <!-- Assessment & Grading -->
      <section class="card">
        <h2>Assessment &amp; Grading</h2>
        <p>
          Assessment is based on continuous work throughout the semester and a final written report.
          All evaluations are carried out individually and in teams according to the nature of the tasks.
        </p>
        <p>
          The final grade is composed of:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Ongoing work (25%)</strong> – individual and group laboratory and independent tasks,
            including use of digital tools, teamwork and participation.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Final written report (75%)</strong> – a comprehensive written report covering all work
            carried out during the semester.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The <strong>20 points</strong> of the final report are divided between:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Structure of the report</li>
          <li>Content and depth of analysis</li>
          <li>Quality of writing and adherence to formal requirements</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The report must include: a YouTube link to the video presentation, a LaTeX transcript
          of the interview, and a structured motivation letter. It is mandatory to submit both
          PDF and LaTeX files on time.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the end of the semester, each student uploads to UFAR’s MOODLE platform:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            An individual report in PDF format named
            <code>BecomeStudentNameSurname.pdf</code>, summarising all tasks completed in the course.
          </li>
          <li>
            A LaTeX file containing the team interview transcript named
            <code>interviewTeamName.tex</code>.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The report is prepared in English (except for content published in Armenian on Wikipedia),
          and the authorship of all uploaded files is checked.

      <!-- Teaching Methods & Prerequisites -->
      <section class="card">
        <h2>Teaching Methods &amp; Prerequisites</h2>
        <p>
          Teaching combines lectures with practical sessions and laboratory work. The course relies
          heavily on digital tools, including the UFAR Moodle platform and various software used for
          programming, version control, project management and communication. Exercises also address
          professional orientation and stability in the chosen field.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are no specific prerequisite courses. The subject is designed as an introductory
          module to support students in their transition from high school to university and to help
          them integrate into the Bachelor program more effectively.
