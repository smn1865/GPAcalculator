        <h2>Aim of the Course</h2>
        <p>
          The aim of “Descriptive Statistics” is to introduce students to the main tools of descriptive
          statistics and to develop skills in collecting, organising, visualising and summarising data.
          The course supports the formation of statistical thinking and the initial ability to draw
          conclusions from data using descriptive methods.

        <h2>Assessment &amp; Grading</h2>
        <p>
          Assessment is based on written examinations, including an intermediate test and a final exam.
          All evaluations are individual. The intermediate exam usually combines a multiple-choice test
          with commentary and 3–4 typical problems with sub-questions. The final exam consists of 4–5
          typical problems with several sub-questions each.
        </p>
        <p>
          The final grade is composed of two written assessments:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Short written test - <strong>1 h 10 min</strong>, weight: <strong>40%</strong>.</li>
          <li>Final written exam - <strong>2 h</strong>, weight: <strong>60%</strong>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Each correct intermediate step is graded, even if the final numerical answer is not correct;
          such steps receive from <strong>0.25</strong> points upwards depending on importance.
          Copying only the problem statement or solving a different problem than the assigned one
          results in <strong>0 points</strong> for that task.
        </p>
        <p>
          Numerical errors typically result in a deduction of <strong>0.25–0.5 points</strong> from
          the points allocated to the problem; if a numerical mistake does not affect the logic
          of the solution, no more than <strong>0.5 points</strong> are subtracted. Logical errors
          lead to at least <strong>0.5 points</strong> being deducted, depending on severity.

        <h2>Teaching Methods &amp; Prerequisites</h2>
        <p>
          Teaching is practice-oriented and based on real and realistic examples, with systematic
          solution of diverse types of problems. Lectures are closely linked with practical work so
          that theoretical concepts are immediately applied to data.
        </p>
        <p>
          To enrol in “Descriptive Statistics”, students should have school-level knowledge of
          algebra. This prerequisite ensures familiarity with basic numerical operations and
          formulas used in statistical calculations.
